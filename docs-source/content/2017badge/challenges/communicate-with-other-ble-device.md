### Challenge 17

If you can get your hands on some other BLE device like a Garmin, Fitbit or Milestone, see if you can figure out the protocol.

If you figure it out, write a blogpost about it!

Some of these devices may require registering on the relevant developer sites. However we may have some other Bluetooth devices on the Hacking Table which are easier to communicate with.
