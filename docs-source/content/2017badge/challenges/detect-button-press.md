### Challenge 2

Reading the instantaneous value of a button is easy (see the getting started docs) but how do you deal with [debouncing](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/switch-bounce-how-to-deal-with-it/) so it's reliable? 

What about more than one button being pressed at the same time?

Help is at hand on the [Espruino site](https://www.espruino.com/Button).

Buttons are a great example of how you write event-driven code with Espruino rather than the more traditional read-loops that people starting on Arduino tend to use.
