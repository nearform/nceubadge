### Challenge 3

It's very easy to read a capacitance value from the 6 lanyard holes in the badge. Experiment with the code and how the badge responds to touch. Then come up with a use for it. 

See the [getting started area](/getting-started/basic-hardware-features/) for the relevant API call.
