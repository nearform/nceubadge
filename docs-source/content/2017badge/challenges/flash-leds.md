### Challenge 4

It's very easy to add LEDs to the 6 corners of your badge. In fact you probably don't even have to solder them. Just stick them in with the short leg oriented to the squared off side of each white circle.

Then try turning them on and off (hint: check the getting started pages). How about some timer-based patterns too? Or controlling them with the buttons?

Note: The low-power nature of the badge means that if you light all LEDs together they'll be quite dim and you'll burn through the battery much more quickly.
