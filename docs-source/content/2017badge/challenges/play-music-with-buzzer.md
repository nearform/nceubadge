### Challenge 5

We have lots of buzzers at the Hacking Station. You just have to solder the red wire to one of the D0-D6 holes on the edge of the badge and the black wire to one of the Ground (-) holes.

Then impress everyone with your groovy tunes using the [APIs here](https://www.espruino.com/Making+Music).

Note: Gordon is working on a variation of this that uses two digital pins and doubles the output volume.
