### Challenge 10

HID means Human Interface Device and it's a standard for connecting Bluetooth input devices like keyboards and mice to computers. Your badge can act as a HID button for your laptop including multimedia keys. You could even use it as a clicker for your talk at NodeConf!

Check out the [instructions here](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js+Keyboard) and try it out for yourself.

Note: Bluetooth HID can't be enabled on an active connection. To make it work you need to upload the code, disconnect, and then reconnect with your Operating System's Bluetooth pairing functionality.
