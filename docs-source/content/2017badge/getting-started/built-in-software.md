Now that you've unlocked the badge (you'll have to do this any time you remove the battery), you can explore the built in sample apps. Out of the box, your badge has the following:

* Your name pre-flashed into the firmware
* Image display cycling
* Selectable menus
* T-Rex who has escaped the Chrome browser
* Flappy Bird
* The world's most awkward on-board REPL
* Etch-a-sketch

Source code for all of these is of course in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/nearform/nceubadge/). More details on these and other samples are [here](/getting-started/other-code-samples/).
