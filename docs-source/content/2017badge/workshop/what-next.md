What about:

* Putting LEDs around the corners and using those to show the correct 
patterns. However, due to the way the capacitive sense and LEDs are shared,
you'll only be able to use White and Blue LEDs, not any of the coloured
ones!
* Getting rid of all the callbacks. I've been super lazy - you could probably
tidy things up a lot more using Promises.
* Make a much better game.
* Use the Bluetooth to connect to another Badge and control it
* Interface with a Web Bluetooth Website
* Make a multiplayer game!

There's loads of info to help online.. Check out:

* The Puck.js tutorials - the badge is basically a Puck.js: http://www.espruino.com/Puck.js#tutorials
* The search box on the Espruino site: http://www.espruino.com/Search
* The Espruino function reference: http://www.espruino.com/Reference
* All the rest of Espruino's tutorials - http://www.espruino.com/Tutorials
* The forum! http://forum.espruino.com/ (it's also sometimes worth
Googling `site:forum.espruino.com your_search_term` as the forum's
search isn't the best).

## Bluetooth

We didn't cover Bluetooth at all here! There's a super-quick intro to
BLE on Espruino here: http://www.espruino.com/About+Bluetooth+LE

And there's a tutorial on how to get up and running with Web Bluetooth
and Espruino here: http://www.espruino.com/Puck.js+Web+Bluetooth
