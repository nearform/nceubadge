# NodeConf EU 2018 Badge

Welcome!

We hope you are as excited as we are about the badge. We've spent the past few months designing and preparing it for the event.

## The Badge

The open source hardware badge contains a small but powerful Bluetooth LE module running [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com) software, which is a JavaScript interpreter optimised for low-power devices. On this site, we'll explain the basics of using and programming the badge and even how to add hardware to it.

## Getting Started

We'll have more info here, including on how to re-flash the firmware on your badge, soon.

## 2017 Badge

The old docs for the 2017 badge can be found in [Getting Started](/2017badge/getting-started/) and [challenges](/2017badge/challenges/).
