### Challenge 12

See if you can connect the Badge to the BLE LED Strip on the table in the hacking lounge and change its colours.

This is a very advanced task and may involve installing the LED strip's mobile app and using the Nordic Semiconductor mobile apps to read changes in the parameters on the strip. 

You can get guidance [here](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js+and+Bluetooth+Lightbulbs) and [here](https://conoroneill.net/using-puck-js-with-kulight-rgb-bluetooth-lightbulb/) but they do not contain a solution specific to this strip.
