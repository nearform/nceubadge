### Challenge 11

You can see that we took all of your names and turned them into images that were included as part of the software of each badge. A different image for every badge. Your challenge is to do something similar. Find an image somewhere, convert it into the correct format and display it on the badge. You'll have lots of fun with Imagemagick outputting blank images or inverted ones :-)

To get started, have a look at the end of [this page](https://www.espruino.com/Graphics) or at the [nasty hacky code](https://github.com/nearform/nceubadge/blob/master/name-generator/bulk-generate.js) we created to generate all the badge images.

Remember the badge is 128x64 monochrome.
