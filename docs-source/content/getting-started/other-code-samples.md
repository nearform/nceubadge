There are three places you can find code to learn from and use:

* The [Badge repo](https://github.com/nearform/nceubadge)
* The [main Espruino site](https://www.espruino.com/)
* The [Puck.js area](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js) of the Espruino site

## Badge Repo Code
The pre-installed main.js code is a treasure trove of useful snippets. Note however that it's too big to be uploaded in its entirety via the Web IDE.
