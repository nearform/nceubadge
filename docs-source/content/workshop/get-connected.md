# Get Connected

The first step is going to be getting set up and connected to your badge. If
you haven't already, check out http://nodeconfeubadge.org/getting-started/
as a getting started guide.

If you're not on a Mac, you might want to check out Puck.js's guide
for setting up the Web IDE: http://www.espruino.com/Puck.js+Quick+Start#using-the-espruino-ide

You should now have a REPL that you can type stuff at!
