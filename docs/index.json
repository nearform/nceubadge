You should get a number displayed in the region of about 10,000 - this value depends on the capacitance on that corner of the badge.\nPress your finger on the corner marked 1 and try again (up arrow, then enter) - you should see a much higher value - probably over 100,000.\nWe can read all 6 corners using ES6 arrow functions and map:\n[1,2,3,4,5,6].map(c=\u0026gt;Badge.capSense(c))  Note that not all corners are identical - for instance the corner nearest the Bluetooth module (corner 3) will probably read a bit less, because there\u0026rsquo;s less wire.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy enough for us to just threshold the capacitance values to return an array of boolean values. You can use up-arrow and left to move the cursor and edit the last line (or even the mouse), but you need to get the cursor on the end of the line before you hit enter or it\u0026rsquo;ll create a newline rather than executing:\n[1,2,3,4,5,6].map(c=\u0026gt;Badge.capSense(c)\u0026gt;20000)  So at this point it\u0026rsquo;d be nice to use the display to show our values\u0026hellip;\n"

This has a bunch of methods such as drawLine or drawString that can be accessed (http://www.espruino.com/Graphics) however each command acts on an internal memory buffer. To update the display itself you need to call g.flip().\nTry entering the following code on the left-hand side:\ng.clear(); g.drawString(\u0026quot;Hello World!\u0026quot;); g.flip();  The badge should now display the obvious \u0026lsquo;Hello World\u0026rsquo;!\nBut what if we want to display our capacitance data? Enter the following on the left-hand side.\nfunction plotCap() { g.clear(); var caps = [1,2,3,4,5,6].map(c=\u0026gt;Badge.capSense(c)); caps.forEach( (cap,x) =\u0026gt; g.fillRect(x*21,64,(x+1)*21, 64-cap/1000) ); g.flip(); } setInterval(plotCap,50)  Note: This uses a whole bunch of battery power because of polling the capacitive sense as well as updating the screen, and if left this way could run the Badge\u0026rsquo;s battery down in a few hours. When using the buttons rather than capacitive sense, the hardware itself can detect the change in the wire\u0026rsquo;s voltage while the processor is asleep - you do that using setWatch - which is super power efficient.\nThis is just displaying a few bars, but it would make more sense to display the status on a hexagon that matched the badge itself:\nfunction plotBadge(presses) { g.clear(); // function to work out each corner's coordinates function corner(c,r) { var a = (c-2)*Math.PI/3; return [64+Math.sin(a)*40*r, 32-Math.cos(a)*30*r]; } // draw a hexagon - a line to each corner in turn g.moveTo.apply(g,corner(6,1)); [1,2,3,4,5,6].forEach(c=\u0026gt;g.lineTo.apply(g,corner(c,1))); // Draw a circle where pressed presses.forEach((hit,c) =\u0026gt; { if (!hit) return; var coords = corner(c+1,0.8); g.fillCircle(coords[0],coords[1],5); }); g.flip(); } function plotCap() { var caps = [1,2,3,4,5,6].map(c=\u0026gt;Badge.capSense(c)\u0026gt;20000); plotBadge(caps); }  We\u0026rsquo;re using a separate plotBadge function here so we can use it later to output the pattern we want the user to enter.\nNote: because we\u0026rsquo;re entering this on the left-hand side we already have the interval from the last code we entered - just re-entering plotCap will replace the old one and the code will magically start working.\n"

There\u0026rsquo;s no speaker built into the badge, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to add one.\nGet one of the gold coloured discs from the hacking bench - these are piezo speakers of the type you\u0026rsquo;d find in digital watches.\nUse the wire strippers and try and strip around 2cm of insulation off each of the two wires. By careful - maybe try stripping 1cm first, then another cm, as the wire is really delicate.\nTwist each bit of wire so it makes a nice braid, then poke each through the holes on the edge of the board marked 0 and 1 (the order doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter) and twist them around tightly as below. 0 and 1 correspond to pins D0 and D1.\nNote: You\u0026rsquo;re welcome to solder the speaker on if you want to - it\u0026rsquo;s just quick and reversible to twist.\nNow get a bit of double-sided tape and tape the speaker to the back of your badge. It makes it louder if it can vibrate something else.\nNow you can test it - in the left-hand side of the IDE type:\ndigitalWrite(D0,0)  This sets pin D0 to be connected to ground.\nanalogWrite(D1,0.5,{freq:1000})  This puts a 1kHz frequency on pin D1, and you should be able to hear a really annoying high pitched beep.\nType this to turn it off:\ndigitalWrite(D1,0)  So now all we need is a handy function to do timed beeps:\nfunction beep(freq, time, callback) { digitalWrite(D0,0); analogWrite(D1,0.5,{freq:freq}); setTimeout(function() { digitalWrite(D1,0); if (callback) callback(); }, time); }  Which you can try with:\nbeep(700,1000)  For a 700Hz beep for 1 second, and so on\u0026hellip;\nFor our Simon game we need a different beep for each corner, so let\u0026rsquo;s make a function for that.\nfunction beepForCorner(corner, time) { var pitches = [\u0026quot;no_corner_0\u0026quot;, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 ]; beep(pitches[corner], time); }  Which you can use with beepForCorner(2,1000).\nThese pitches are totally un-musical, but if you were so inclined you could look up some more pleasing notes at https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html and use those frequencies instead.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s too quiet! (optional!)\nUnfortunately the piezo speakers we\u0026rsquo;re using aren\u0026rsquo;t really meant to run off a voltage as low as we have on the badge (3V).\nWe\u0026rsquo;re driving them with a square wave between 0V and 3V while D0 is at 0V, so the total swing in voltage is 0V.\nHowever, if we could make D0 go to 3V when D1 was at 0V and vice-versa, we\u0026rsquo;d be able to get double the voltage swing - 6V!\nThe following code uses the NRF52LL library, which has a bit more info in it: http://www.espruino.com/NRF52LL\nBasically there\u0026rsquo;s nothing built in to the Espruino interpreter to handle this, so we have to set up the hardware that\u0026rsquo;s on the chip ourself - which is pretty low-level.\n function beep(freq, time, callback) { var ll = require(\u0026quot;NRF52LL\u0026quot;); // set up D0 and D1 as outputs digitalWrite(D0,0); digitalWrite(D1,0); // create two 'toggle' tasks, one for each pin var t0 = ll.gpiote(6, {type:\u0026quot;task\u0026quot;,pin:D0,lo2hi:1,hi2lo:1,initialState:0}); var t1 = ll.gpiote(7, {type:\u0026quot;task\u0026quot;,pin:D1,lo2hi:1,hi2lo:1,initialState:1}); // create a timer that counts up to a value depending on the frequency var tmr = ll.timer(3,{cc:[500000/freq],cc0clear:1}); // use two PPI to trigger toggle events ll.ppiEnable(6, tmr.eCompare[0], t0.tOut); ll.ppiEnable(7, tmr.eCompare[0], t1.tOut); // Manually trigger a task to start the timer poke32(tmr.tClear,1); poke32(tmr.tStart,1); setTimeout(function() { poke32(tmr.tStop,1); ll.ppiDisable(6); ll.ppiDisable(7); if (callback) callback(); }, time); }  This code uses a library that\u0026rsquo;s dynamically loaded in by the IDE, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to use the code on the right-hand side of the IDE and use the Upload button in order to have it work correctly.\n"

No changes will take effect until you press the Upload button, but when you upload it\u0026rsquo;ll blow away any previous changes you made on the left-hand side.\nOutputting a pattern We\u0026rsquo;ve already got the plotBadge function from the Graphics section, as well as beepForCorner from the Sound section. All we need to do is call them at the right times. Copy plotBadge and the beep stuff onto the right-hand side, as well as this - and then click the Upload button in the middle of the screen.\n// Show the given pattern function showPattern(pattern, callback) { // Nothing left - finish if (!pattern.length) return callback(); // Shift off the first element - don't use shift as // that'd alter the initial array var corner = pattern[0]; pattern = pattern.slice(1); // Display a corner and beep plotBadge([corner==1, corner==2, corner==3, corner==4, corner==5, corner==6]); beepForCorner(corner, 1000); // clear screen after a timeout setTimeout(function() { g.clear(); g.flip(); // go to next setTimeout(function() { showPattern(pattern, callback); }, 200); }, 1000); } showPattern([1,2,3,4], ()=\u0026gt;console.log(\u0026quot;Done!\u0026quot;));  Detecting the pattern So now you need the following to detect the pattern sequence - it\u0026rsquo;s a bit big, but there are comments below:\n/* Wait for either a corner to be pressed (pressState=true) or released (pressState=false), and report back what was pressed in the callback */ function waitForPress(pressState, callback) { var intr = setInterval(function() { // Detect pressed corners var pressed = [1,2,3,4,5,6].map(c=\u0026gt;Badge.capSense(c)\u0026gt;20000); // Create a string of only the pressed corners pressed = pressed.map((x,i)=\u0026gt;x?i+1:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;).join(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;); // Call the callback when something is either pressed or released if ((pressed!=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) == pressState) { clearInterval(intr); callback(pressed); } },20); } // Draw big fullscreen, centered text function plotText(txt) { g.clear(); var size = 32; g.setFontVector(size); while (g.stringWidth(txt)\u0026gt;120) { g.setFontVector(--size); } g.drawString(txt,(128-g.stringWidth(txt))/2,(64-size)/2); g.setFontBitmap(); g.flip(); } // Repeatedly test for the correct pattern function testPattern(pattern, callback) { // Nothing left - finish - I guess we passed if (!pattern.length) return callback(true); // Shift off the first element - don't use shift as // that'd alter the initial array var corner = pattern[0]; pattern = pattern.slice(1); // Wait for a press plotText(\u0026quot;?\u0026quot;); waitForPress(true, function(pressedCorner) { // check our corner if (pressedCorner == corner) { plotText(corner); beepForCorner(corner, 1000); // Great!

Schematics and board design files are available in the /hardware directory of the repo.\nThe badge uses the same core module as the Puck.js and can run most of the same software.\nHardware Features include:\n nRF52832 SoC - 64MHz ARM Cortex M4, 64kB RAM, 512kB Flash, running the Espruino stack Bluetooth Low Energy Powered by a CR2032 battery which can last up to a week depending on what code you are running Daylight-readable LCD screen 6 input buttons Capacitive touch sensors on all 6 corners Digital I/O on all 6 corners Analogue-in on 3 corners Prototyping area with 8 CPU pins accessible Digital I/O on all 8 pins Analogue-in on 4 pins Holes for LEDs on all 6 corners NFC antenna SWD programming pins  Proto holes and corner holes You write or read a digital high/low to/from a hole with:\ndigitalWrite(hole, value); digitalRead(hole);  where hole is one of D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8 (D0 at top), CORNER1, CORNER2, CORNER3, CORNER4, CORNER5, CORNER6 and value is 0 or 1.\nYou read an analogue value from a hole with:\nanalogRead(hole);  where hole is one of D2, D3, D4, D5, CORNER4, CORNER5, CORNER6.\nButtons You can use a generic call like\ndigitalRead(button);  where button is one of BTNA, BTNB, BTNU, BTND, BTNL, BTNR\nor with a Button-specific call\nBTNx.read();  where BTNx is one of BTNA, BTNB, BTNU, BTND, BTNL, BTNR\nLEDs If you add LEDs to the corner holes, you can turn them on/off with a generic call\ndigitalWrite(led, value);  where led is one of LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4, LED5, LED6.\nor with an LED-specific call\nLEDx.write(value);  where LEDx is one of LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4, LED5, LED6 and value is 0 or 1.\nGraphics In many Espruino examples on the main site, you\u0026rsquo;ll find setup code for different types of screens. That has already been taken care of for you on the badge and you can just access the graphics functions directly. e.g.\ng.clear(); g.drawString(\u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;,0,0); g.flip();  Capacitive Sense You can read the capacitance (and hence touch) from the 6 corners using\nBadge.capSense(corner);  where corner is one of CORNER1, CORNER2, CORNER3, CORNER4, CORNER5, CORNER6. See note here about issue of using sense and LEDs together.\nBattery Percentage You can get an estimate of the battery level by calling\nBadge.getBatteryPercentage();  It returns an approximate battery percentage remaining based on a normal CR2032 battery (2.8 - 2.2v).\nSet Screen Contrast You can set the screen contrast with\nBadge.setContrast(c)  where c is a float from 0 to 1\nNFC You can set the URL that the NFC antenna broadcasts to NFC-capable phones by calling\nNRF.nfcURL(\u0026quot;url\u0026quot;)  where URL is something like https://www.nearform.com\nAdvanced Only: Flashing updated firmware If you need to flash new firmware to the badge, you must first put it in DFU mode by holding BTNA as you insert the battery and quickly letting go of BTNA. Download the Distribution Packet Zip file containing the new firmware to your phone and use nRF Toolbox on either Android or iOS to send it to the badge.\nPlease only do this if you are sure you need it. By using a stock badge build from the Espruino site, you\u0026rsquo;ll lose the built-in NodeConf EU main.js code and will just have a REPL over Bluetooth on your badge.\n"

Any attendee can enter. There are no limits on what you can do but it must make use of the Badge. It can be software, hardware or a mix of both. It can involve Bluetooth but doesn’t have to.\nAnyone who wishes to enter must demo their completed entry to the judges between 4.30pm and 5pm on Wednesday Nov 8th in the Hacking Lounge.\nThe winner will be announced at the Closing Party dinner on Wednesday night. They and the runners-up will demo what they have created to the crowd.\n"
